# 🧾 Student Record Management System (Java)

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Student Record Management System** is a simple Java console-based application designed to store and manage student details.  
It demonstrates the concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** such as **classes**, **inheritance**, **methods**, and **encapsulation**.

This project allows users to:
- Add new student records  
- Display all stored student records  
- Exit the program safely

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java (JDK 24 or higher)
- **Concepts Covered:**  
  - Inheritance  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Object creation  
  - User input handling using `Scanner`

## 🧩 Class Structure

### 1. `Person` (Parent Class)
- **Attributes:**
  - `name` — stores student’s name.  
- **Purpose:** Acts as a base class for inheritance.

- **Attributes:**
  - `rollNo` — student’s roll number  
  - `course` — course name  
  - `marks` — total marks  
  - `grade` — grade (calculated automatically)
- **Methods:**
  - `inputDetails()` — accepts user input for student details.  
  - `calculateGrade()` — assigns grade based on marks.  
  - `displayDetails()` — prints student information.

### 3. `StudentRecordSystem` (Main Class)
- **Functionality:**  
  Contains the `main()` method that provides a simple **menu-driven interface** for users.
